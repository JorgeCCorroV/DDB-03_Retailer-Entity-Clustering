Let's consider that you, as a data scientist, are working for **Retailer A**, a large-scale department store chain. Retailer A has recently entered into a strategic partnership with **Retailer B**, an online e-commerce platform specializing in products. As part of this partnership, Retailer B has shared its product descriptions dataset with Retailer A for the purpose of cross-promotion, product indexing and targeted marketing.

Your task is to perform **entity resolution**, also known as record linkage, on these datasets. The goal is to identify which products in Retailer B's dataset are also products of Retailer A. This will allow the marketing department to create more personalized product offering campaigns and product indexes.
